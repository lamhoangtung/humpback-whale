# Humpback Whale Identification Competition
My Keras Resnet50 baseline for the Humpback Whale Identification Competition. 

## How to use
Download dataset from Kaggle, extract and move it to `./data`. Then run `first_run.py`, then `second_run.py`, then `third_run.py` sequentially.

Make sure to set the previous checkpoint path when run `second_run.py` and `third_run.py`
